Every `.mdx` file in your project becomes a page. The file path determines the URL.

## Frontmatter

Each page starts with frontmatter — metadata between `---` fences:

```mdx
---
title: My Page Title
description: A short description for search engines
---

Your content starts here.
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | Page title shown in the browser tab and sidebar |
| `description` | No | Meta description for SEO |

## File organization

Your file structure maps directly to URLs:

```
introduction.mdx        → /introduction
quickstart.mdx          → /quickstart
guides/deployment.mdx   → /guides/deployment
api/users/list.mdx      → /api/users/list
```

## Markdown features

MDX supports all standard Markdown:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- `Inline code` and fenced code blocks
- [Links](https://example.com) and images
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Tables and blockquotes
- Headings (`##`, `###`, `####`)

<Note>
Headings on the page automatically appear in the right sidebar as a table of contents.
