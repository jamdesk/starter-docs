description: How pages and frontmatter work
---

Every `.mdx` file becomes a page. The file path determines the URL.

## Frontmatter

Each page starts with frontmatter between `---` fences:

```mdx
---
title: Authentication
description: API keys, OAuth tokens, and webhook signatures
---

Your content starts here.
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | Page title — browser tab and sidebar |
| `description` | No | Meta description for SEO |
| `sidebarTitle` | No | Shorter name for the sidebar (overrides `title`) |
| `icon` | No | Font Awesome icon next to the page in the sidebar |
| `openapi` | No | OpenAPI operation to auto-generate an API reference page |

## File structure → URLs

```
introduction.mdx        → /introduction
quickstart.mdx          → /quickstart
guides/webhooks.mdx     → /guides/webhooks
api/payments/list.mdx   → /api/payments/list
```

## Markdown

MDX supports everything in standard Markdown:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- `Inline code` and fenced code blocks
- [Links](https://example.com) and images
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Tables and blockquotes
- Headings (`##`, `###`, `####`)

<Note>
Headings automatically appear in the right sidebar as a table of contents.
