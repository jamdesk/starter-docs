Your docs are MDX files in a GitHub repo. Push a commit, and the site rebuilds automatically.

## Edit a page

Open any `.mdx` file and start writing. MDX is Markdown with components baked in.

## API Keys

Every request requires an API key in the `Authorization` header:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.acme.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123"
```

```javascript Node.js
const acme = new Acme('sk_live_abc123');
```
</CodeGroup>
````

## Add a new page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an MDX file">
    Add a file anywhere in your project — for example, `guides/webhooks.mdx`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add it to navigation">
    Open `docs.json` and add the page path to a group:

    ```json
    {
      "group": "Guides",
      "pages": ["guides/webhooks"]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push to GitHub">
    Commit and push. The site rebuilds in about 30 seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize your site

Everything lives in `docs.json`:

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `name` | Site name in the header |
| `colors` | Brand colors (primary, light, dark) |
| `logo` | Light and dark mode logos |
| `theme` | Visual theme — `jam`, `nebula`, or `pulsar` |
| `navigation` | Sidebar groups and page order |
| `navbar` | Top nav links and buttons |

<Tip>
See the [full configuration reference](https://jamdesk.com/docs/config/docs-json-reference) for every available field.
</Tip>
