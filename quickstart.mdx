description: Edit, customize, and deploy your docs

Your docs are built from MDX files in this repository. Every push to GitHub triggers an automatic build and deploy.

## Edit a page

Open any `.mdx` file and start writing. MDX supports standard Markdown plus Jamdesk components.

```mdx
---
title: My Page
description: A brief description for SEO
---

# Heading

Regular markdown works — **bold**, *italic*, `code`, [links](https://example.com).
```

## Add a new page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an MDX file">
    Add a new `.mdx` file anywhere in your project, for example `guides/deployment.mdx`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add it to navigation">
    Open `docs.json` and add the page path to the `navigation` section:

    ```json
    {
      "group": "Guides",
      "pages": ["guides/deployment"]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push to GitHub">
    Commit and push. Your site will rebuild automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize your site

Everything is configured in `docs.json`:

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `name` | Site name shown in the header |
| `colors` | Primary, light, and dark accent colors |
| `logo` | Light and dark mode logo images |
| `theme` | Visual theme (`jam`, `nebula`, or `pulsar`) |
| `navigation` | Sidebar tabs, groups, and page order |
| `navbar` | Top navigation links and buttons |

<Tip>
See the full configuration reference at [jamdesk.com/docs](https://jamdesk.com/docs).

## Use the CLI

Install the Jamdesk CLI for local development:

```bash
npm install -g jamdesk
```

Preview your docs locally:

```bash
jamdesk dev
```

This starts a local server with hot reload so you can see changes instantly.
