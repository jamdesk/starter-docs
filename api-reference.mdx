description: Two ways to document your API — OpenAPI or hand-authored
---

## From an OpenAPI spec

If you have an OpenAPI spec, drop it in the `/openapi` directory and point a page at it. Jamdesk auto-generates the full endpoint documentation — parameters, response schemas, and code examples.

```mdx
---
title: Create Payment
openapi: /openapi/acme.yaml POST /payments
---
```

One line of frontmatter, and you get a complete API reference page.

Register your spec in `docs.json` for build-time validation:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "openapi": ["/openapi/acme.yaml"]
  }
}
```

Check the **Create Payment** and **List Payments** pages in the sidebar — they're auto-generated from the sample spec included in this starter.

## Hand-authored

No OpenAPI spec? Write endpoints directly with `ParamField` and `ResponseField`:

```mdx
<ParamField query="status" type="string">
  Filter by payment status. One of `succeeded`, `pending`, `failed`.
</ParamField>

<ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
  Payment ID. Starts with `pay_`.
</ResponseField>
```

| Component | Use for |
|-----------|---------|
| `<ParamField path="...">` | URL path params (`/users/{id}`) |
| `<ParamField query="...">` | Query string (`?limit=10`) |
| `<ParamField body="...">` | Request body fields |
| `<ParamField header="...">` | HTTP headers |
| `<ResponseField>` | Response fields |
| `<Expandable>` | Nested objects inside a ResponseField |

<Tip>
OpenAPI is the faster path if you already have a spec. Hand-authored is better when you want full control over the layout, or when your API doesn't have a spec yet.
